# A New Primal-Dual Algorithm for Continuous Euclidean k-means
### Anthony Zhan, Ishan Khare
### Advised by Prof. Moses Charikar and Prof. Aviad Rubinstein, as well as Ruiquan Guo (Stanford University) and Lorenzo Beretta (University of Copenhagen)

Project funded by Stanford's CURIS internship during summer 2023, and research continued during fall 2023. For a poster (including references to SOTA k-means approximation algorithms), see [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14yAfFOTk8dLJ7_S_AXaHDDDF8aSAKSIx/view?usp=sharing).

The code in this GitHub mainly serves as a tool to build small tests and experiments. In particular, we do not currently have a full implementation of the primal-dual algorithm.
